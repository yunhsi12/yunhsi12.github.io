			<p >My name is Yun-Hsi Tsao. People usually call me Manda, which is an abbreviation of Amanda. I’m from Kaohsiung, which is why my skin is tan. I usually like to emerge myself in the scorching sun especially in the summer. It makes me feel energetic! However, my favorite month is not in summer but in winter, which is December. I love December not only because my birthday is on December 12 but also because Christmas, my favorite holiday, is also in December! I love places full of sparkling Christmas trees and decorations which make me feel a lot of happiness.

			 <p>I’m now studying at National Tsing Hua University for my second year and majoring in foreign language and literature. For over a year of study, I found that I’m more interested in linguistics than literature, especially the relation between languages and our mysterious brain. Therefore, I hope I can be a language therapist in the future. I would like to use my professional knowledge to help people to communicate with others more smoothly. I care about people and this job would make me feel meaningful.

			<p>As for my interest, since I have been a coffee lover since I was in high school, I think it’s time to learn more knowledge about coffee instead of just drinking without knowing the difference between coffee. Therefore, I joined a beverage club this year. I have organized some notes of coffee knowledge that I learned. If you’re also interested in coffee, click on <a href="topic.html">COFFEE</a> to know more!</p>
