		<p style="background-color: #FFBD9D">	My name is Yun Hsi Tsao. People usually call me Manda, which is an abbreviation of Amanda. I’m from Kaohsiung, which is why my skin is tan. However, I’m not as passionate as the hot sun in Kaohsiung. I consider myself as a calm person similar to the calm wind in Kaohsiung. I’m studying in National Tsing Hua university for my second year and majoring in foreign language and literature. Besides my major, I also study some courses related to program of speech and language therapy. I would like to be a language therapist in the future, so I became an intern of a professor Yang to learn more medical knowledge recently. Moreover, I joined a beverage club this year in order to learn some knowledge and skills of coffee . The reason that I joined this club is not only because I have been a coffee lover since I was in high school but also because I want to know more people.</p> 
		<p style="background-color:#FF9D6F"> 我是曹芸熙。大家通常都叫我曼達，也就是我的英文名字Amanda的簡稱。我來自高雄，這也說明了我為何我有著黝黑的皮膚。然而，我的個性卻不像高雄太陽一樣熱情如火，我想我比較像是高雄平靜的風一般冷靜的人。我現在正在就讀清華大學外國語言學系，目前大二。除了我的主修之外，我也修習一些跟語言治療學分學成相關的課程。我希望我未來能夠成為一名語言治療師，因此我最近開始擔任楊教授的實習生以便我更了解一些醫學的知識。除此之外，我今年加入了飲品社去學習咖啡相關的知識與技巧。而我會加入這個社團除了是因為我從高中以來就一直是一個愛好者外，我還想要藉此認識更多人。
