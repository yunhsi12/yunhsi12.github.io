		My name is Yun Hsi Tsao. People usually call me Manda, which is an abbreviation of Amanda. I’m from Kaohsiung, which is why my skin is tan. However, I’m not as passionate as the hot sun in Kaohsiung. I consider myself as a calm person similar to the calm wind in Kaohsiung. I’m studying in National Tsing Hua university for my second year and majoring in foreign language and literature. Besides my major, I also study some courses related to program of speech and language therapy. I would like to be a language therapist in the future, so I became an intern of a professor Yang to learn more medical knowledge recently. Moreover, I joined a beverage club this year in order to learn some knowledge and skills of coffee . The reason that I joined this club is not only because I have been a coffee lover since I was in high school but also because I want to know more people.
