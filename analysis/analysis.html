    			<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
    			<p>In the opening paragraph <a href="example.html#sec1">[Sec. #1]</a>, the last sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement for the two reasons. First, it contains the keyword <q>APOE4</q>, which is mentioned on the topic and discussed throughout the entire essay. Plus, there are two key points which are discussed in the following article: <q>boost short-term memory</q> and <q>protect against subtle memory lost in the course of Alzheimer's disease</q>.

    			<p class="quote"><q>A common genetic variant called APOE4 raises a person’s risk of Alzheimer’s disease. It also poses a puzzle: If APOE4 is so bad for us, why hasn’t it been weeded out from the population? A new study finds that, surprisingly,<span style="background-color:#80cdc1"> the APOE4 variant has positive cognitive impacts: It may not only boost short-term memory but also protect against subtle memory loss early in the course of Alzheimer’s disease.</span></q></p>

    					<b><a href="example.html#sec2">[Sec. #2]</a> - Brief introduction of APOE4 and why it remains  </b><br/>
    					This section is mainly about APOE4 and answering the question in the opening paragraph <q>If APOE4 is so bad for us, why hasn't it been weeded out from the population?</q> with the answer<q>one possible explanation for its staying power is that one copy is beneficial</q>.

    					In the first paragraph of this section, the key sentence <q>a larger study found that APOE4 carriers across a range of ages perform slightly better than noncarriers on a test requiring them to quickly recall an object and its location</q>, which this section is going to talk about. Moreover, in the second and third paragraph, it shows <q>APOE4 seemed to have a beneficial effect</q>, <q>the benefits of APOE4 are limited</q> and <q>performed better on some verbal tests of short-term memory, but not on long-term memory test</q>.

    			<h2>Take-home message</h2>
    			<p>
    				The last paragraph tells readers its conclusion in a really simple and clear way by citing the author on a paper on APOE4 and short memory Nahid Zokaei and co-worker of the study mentioned in the article Jonathan Schott. Their words show that the findings of the study give big benefits to <q>“the mechanism of Alzheimer’s and how our brain works”</q> and <q>give pause to researchers</q> who want to block APOE4’s protein, for the study argues that APOE4 may have benefits to human memory. The last sentence clearly tells
    			 <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;"> the readers, especially the researchers who are doing research on related fields that we should focus on both advantages and disadvantages of APOE4.</span></p>

    			<p class="quote"><q> University of Oxford psychologist Nahid Zokaei, lead author on the 2020 paper on APOE4 and short-term memory, says the findings could shed light on “the mechanism of Alzheimer’s and how our brain works” by revealing “how these compensatory mechanisms kick in and take up the slack.” ///// The study should also give pause to researchers developing Alzheimer’s treatments that block APOE4’s protein, Schott says. “If we’re thinking about targeting APOE4, we really need to know what the advantages and the disadvantages might be at different ages.”</q></p>
